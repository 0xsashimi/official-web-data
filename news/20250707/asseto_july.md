## HashKey Group Completes Strategic Investment in Asseto to Accelerate RWA Tokenization

Hong Kong, July 7, 2025 — HashKey Group, Asia’s leading digital asset financial services group, today announced the completion of a strategic investment in fintech firm Asseto Holdings Limited (“Asseto”). This partnership marks a deep collaboration between both parties in the field of RWA (Real World Assets) tokenization, with the shared goal of building an efficient and scalable on-chain asset infrastructure, advancing stablecoin ecosystems, and bridging traditional finance with decentralized economies to promote large-scale adoption of digital asset infrastructure.

This is not merely a strategic investment, but also the beginning of a comprehensive collaboration between Asseto and HashKey in the RWA space. Leveraging their respective strengths, the two parties will jointly build a high-performance, scalable on-chain asset platform that bridges Traditional Finance (TradFi) and Decentralized Finance (DeFi), promoting industry-wide compliance, standardization, and institutionalization.

One of the key highlights of this collaboration is the integration of Asseto’s institutional-grade RWA issuance capabilities with HashKey Chain, HashKey Group’s proprietary high-performance Layer 2 blockchain platform. The two teams will co-develop end-to-end technical solutions to support the on-chain issuance, settlement, and circulation of various financial assets including cash management instruments, funds, and bonds, ensuring seamless, traceable flow between off-chain and on-chain environments. Asseto will prioritize deploying its premium RWA products natively within the HashKey Chain ecosystem. In the future, users will be able to access these diverse on-chain assets easily through HashKey’s trading platforms and other channels.

In this strategic cooperation, HashKey Chain plays a dual role as both foundational infrastructure and technical enabler for the entire RWA tokenization process. As a high-performance Layer 2 network tailored for financial-grade assets, HashKey Chain provides standardized solutions across critical areas such as smart contract standards and modular deployment—offering structured protocols and frameworks essential for securely issuing complex asset structures on-chain.

Additionally, HashKey Chain will serve as one of the primary chains for Asseto’s diversified RWA products. Through ecosystem incentives, liquidity support, and developer resources, HashKey Chain will help onboard projects into the broader on-chain financial network. This collaboration further demonstrates HashKey Chain’s strong adaptability in real-world asset use cases and solidifies its position in shaping global RWA infrastructure standards.

The partnership also extends into education and academic-industry collaboration. On June 30, 2025, Asseto and HashKey became founding signatories of a strategic Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU). Together, they will advance academic research, talent development, and industry ecosystem growth in areas such as blockchain finance, RWA standardization, and digital asset regulation, supporting Hong Kong’s ambition to become a globally recognized hub for digital finance innovation.

Looking ahead, Asseto and HashKey plan to deepen cooperation across multiple dimensions, including cross-border pilots and industry standard development, to foster healthy growth in the global RWA market. The two organizations aim to accelerate the compliant deployment of new asset classes such as stablecoins, tokenized funds, and on-chain bonds, facilitating the full transition of traditional financial assets into Web3 architecture.

This strategic investment represents HashKey Group’s recognition of Asseto’s technological expertise, product capabilities, and long-term vision, laying a solid foundation for both parties to build a leading RWA tokenization ecosystem in Asia. By jointly developing technical infrastructure, exchanges, custody systems, research initiatives, and regulatory engagement mechanisms, the two parties will drive forward the standardization and scalability of RWA infrastructure, unlocking the long-term potential of on-chain finance.
