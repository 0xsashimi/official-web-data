## Asseto's Core Fund Product AoABT Officially Deployed on HashKey Chain
The core fund product AoABT, supported by the next-generation real-world asset platform Asseto, has been officially deployed on HashKey Chain in May 2025. This marks the first time a funding rate arbitrage strategy has been made available to professional investors in an on-chain format, promoting deep integration between traditional financial strategies and blockchain technology.
AoABT's underlying strategy is a funding rate arbitrage managed by an experienced crypto trading team, with Orient Asset Management (Hong Kong), a subsidiary of Orient Securities International, serving as advisor. Through a long-short hedging structure, the strategy captures funding fee and price difference opportunities that exist between exchanges while avoiding market price fluctuations. 

Over the past five years, it has achieved an annualized return of 20% with a maximum historical drawdown of less than 1%. Currently, the total assets under management for this strategy exceed $500 million （Data Source: Underlying Fund Information from AoABT）.
The version of AoABT launched on HashKey Chain has a minimum investment amount of $100,000 (or equivalent in USDT) for its underlying fund, offering various share options including priority returns and floating returns. This represents the first unified entry point for this strategy for both off-chain and on-chain users, building a technical and compliant channel between traditional assets and the crypto ecosystem. The on-chain issuance is accompanied by smart contract processes for subscription, redemption, and asset mapping, greatly improving user participation efficiency and transparency of fund circulation.

The Asseto team consists of members from top international financial institutions such as Morgan Stanley, Standard Chartered Bank, and E Fund, with strategic partners including HashKey Group and Fosun Wealth. The platform is committed to providing solutions for bringing real assets on-chain while also opening off-chain asset allocation channels to build an asset network with "two-way circulation between on-chain and off-chain."
HashKey Chain, as a leading performance public chain infrastructure backed by HashKey Group's regulatory background, is dedicated to creating a trustworthy and scalable environment for RWA assets. This collaboration with Asseto represents an important step toward high-quality structured development of on-chain RWA infrastructure and provides a new model for institutional funds' on-chain allocation.
With the official deployment of AoABT, Asseto will further advance the on-chain deployment of its supported money market funds, BTC arbitrage, and multi-strategy products, while exploring integration paths with DeFi protocols. The goal is to build a composable, low-threshold, highly transparent on-chain wealth management system on HashKey Chain, injecting more replicable and scalable asset types into the RWA sector。
