## HashKey Chain Launches Paimon SpaceX SPV Token on Mainnet

July 16, 2025, Hong Kong – HashKey Chain announced the successful deployment of $SPCX (Paimon SpaceX SPV Token), a tokenized special purpose fund share backed by U.S.-based aerospace company SpaceX, on its mainnet. As the go-to public chain for finance and real-world assets (RWA), HashKey Chain continues to serve as a core platform for institutional asset tokenization. This partnership with tokenization platform Paimon Finance marks the first time a premium global pre-IPO equity asset class has been brought onchain, offering investors access to early-stage growth opportunities in top-tier private companies. Currently, $SPCX is deployed exclusively on HashKey Chain and BNB Chain.

Issued by Paimon, $SPCX is backed by a special purpose vehicle (*SPV) incorporated in the British Virgin Islands (BVI), granting investors indirect exposure to SpaceX’s equity. Each unit of $SPCX is currently priced at USD 220, representing a 10–30% discount compared to comparable secondary market offerings of SpaceX private equity. $SPCX is now live and interactive onchain; users can redeem and trade the token directly via https://app.paimon.finance/spcx,the limit is 15 million US dollars.*SPV (Special Purpose Vehicle) is a legal entity established for a specific investment or asset-holding purpose. Commonly used for risk isolation, structured design, and operational flexibility, the SPV in the $SPCX product holds the investment interest in the SpaceX equity fund. This structure ensures both legal and financial independence for the tokenized asset, helping safeguard investor rights and enhance product compliance.

Kay, Head of HashKey Chain, said:
“The onchain issuance of high-barrier, top-tier private assets like SPCX represents one of the ultimate use cases for RWA. Through our collaboration with Paimon, HashKey Chain aims to bridge premium alternative assets with onchain liquidity—empowering more users to participate in the growth of global industry leaders and the rise of the space economy.”

Guyan, Co-Founder of Paimon, added:
“We believe that most assets will eventually have an onchain form, and category-defining names like SpaceX should lead this shift. As the second blockchain infrastructure we’ve chosen after BNB Chain, HashKey Chain allows us to enhance access and capital efficiency for global investors seeking high-quality exposure.”

Paimon’s selection of HashKey Chain reflects rising expectations among a new generation of asset issuers: that a public chain should not only offer the technical capacity to host tokenized assets, but also serve as a conduit of institutional-grade trust and shared value. As more high-quality RWAs—ranging from primary market equity and funds to minerals, collectibles, and carbon credits—come onchain, the scope of Onchain Finance continues to expand. Regardless of asset complexity, compliance rigor, or global investor liquidity demands, HashKey Chain has proven its full-stack capability as a next-generation financial infrastructure.
