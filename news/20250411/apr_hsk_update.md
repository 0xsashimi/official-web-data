# HashKey Chain & HSK Token Monthly Update: Ecosystem Expansion, Staking Milestones, and Global Builder Momentum

## Overview

March was a milestone month across the HashKey ecosystem, marked by major product launches, developer activations in Asia, and the ongoing growth of the HSK token utility. As we continue to scale our infrastructure and community, here’s a snapshot of what we accomplished together.

## Web3 Festival in Hong Kong: Building the Future with Confidence

In March, HashKey Group hosted the Web3 Festival in Hong Kong, bringing together builders, regulators, investors, and ecosystem partners to explore the next phase of decentralized technologies.

HashKey Chain was featured across key sessions, demos, and panels—highlighting use cases for tokenization, infrastructure innovation, and compliance-aligned Web3 growth.

## Asia Developer Activations: Taipei Meetup & Seoul Hackathon

As part of our regional community push, HashKey Chain launched two builder-focused events in March:

- Taipei Meetup: An intimate gathering with local Web3 builders, partners, and institutions focused on PayFi, DeFi, and ecosystem expansion.

These efforts are helping build localized communities and developer pipelines across Asia’s most active markets.
