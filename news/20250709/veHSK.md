## HashKey Chain Officially Launches the veHSK Governance Mechanism

July 9, 2025, Hong Kong — HashKey Chain Officially Launches veHSK (vote-escrowed HSK), Introducing a New Governance Mechanism to Its Mainnet Ecosystem
HashKey Chain has officially launched veHSK (vote-escrowed HSK), a non-transferable governance token earned by staking the native token HSK. veHSK represents not only users’ onchain voting rights, but also their long-term commitment to and co-construction of the chain’s public infrastructure. At HashKey Chain, we believe governance should be rooted in long-termism and centered around real contributors. The launch of veHSK marks a key step toward building a more decentralized, transparent, and accountability-driven governance framework.
 
Strengthening Governance to Safeguard Long-Termism
HashKey Chain adopts a dual-track veHSK governance model:
- In routine governance scenarios—such as parameter fine-tuning, incentive allocation, or whitelist updates—veHSK can be used for non-consuming voting, encouraging active participation.
- In major governance decisions—such as grant approvals or protocol upgrade proposals (HashKey Improvement Proposals, HIPs)—veHSK will be partially consumed, adding prudence and authority to the process.
We believe this dual-track voting system effectively balances community engagement and governance stability, ensuring governance power is concentrated among long-term participants committed to the chain’s development, rather than influenced by short-term market sentiment.

Multi-Dimensional Incentives: Governance as a Gateway to Ecosystem Yield
Beyond being a governance credential, veHSK also serves as a gateway to ecosystem participation and shared returns. As currently planned, veHSK holders will gain increased rights and access to ecosystem benefits, including but not limited to:
- Voting and incentive-sharing rights for ecosystem grant proposals;
- Priority access to Launchpad offerings for onchain assets;
- Governance rights over interest rate parameters for RWA-type assets;
- Revenue-sharing linked to project-specific proposals;
- Reputational scores and incentives tied to voting behavior.
Through this “Participate–Govern–Earn” loop, veHSK becomes the first form of governance asset in a compliant financial ecosystem that is underpinned by long-term value.

Transparent Rules, Continuous Participation
Users can stake HSK to obtain veHSK via: https://www.hskhodlium.xyz/
The amount of veHSK received is proportional to the staked amount and lock-up period, following a linear release model, with the release rate determined by the lock duration—encouraging long-term holding and predictable governance behavior.
The launch of veHSK marks a mature evolution in governance design and community incentives for HashKey Chain, transitioning the public chain from foundational infrastructure to mechanism optimization. This is a practical response to the evolving needs of onchain financial governance. HashKey Chain will continue refining veHSK use cases and governance UX, empowering more real users to stake to govern and govern to co-build, driving long-term momentum for building an open, efficient, and trusted financial mainchain.

## 2025年7月9日，香港 —— HashKey Chain现宣布正式上线veHSK（vote-escrowed HSK），为主网生态注入全新治理机制。

veHSK是通过质押原生代币HSK所获得的不可转让治理凭证，其首先代表了用户的链上投票权，同时也象征着用户在公共基础设施中的长期参与及共建。HashKey Chain始终认为，治理应以长期主义为基础，以真实参与者为核心，veHSK的上线必将有助于构建一个更为去中心化、透明且具备责任约束的链上治理体系。

强化治理，保障长期主义
HashKey Chain采用了veHSK双轨制治理模型：
- 在日常治理场景中，如协议参数微调、激励配置、资产白名单更新等，veHSK可用于无消耗投票，提升治理活跃度；
- 在重大治理决策中，如Grants发放、协议升级提案（HashKey Improvement Proposals, EIP）等，veHSK将被部分消耗，以增强投票的审慎性与权威性。
我们相信双轨制投票系统能够有效平衡社区参与热度与治理稳定性，确保治理权更集中于真正关注链上生态发展的长期用户，避免市场的短期情绪干扰长期建设目标。

多维激励，让治理权成为生态收益的入口
HashKey Chain不仅将veHSK作为治理凭证，还进一步将其作为生态参与及收益共享的入口。按现有规划，持有veHSK的用户在未来能够拥有更多的参与权与收益权，包括但不限于：
- 对生态项目Grants提案的投票权与激励分成权；
- 对链上资产Launchpad的认购优先权；
- 对RWA类资产的利率参数治理权；
- 与参与项目提案绑定的协议收益共享权；
- 投票行为带来的Reputational score与激励。
通过【参与-治理-收益】这一闭环，veHSK将成为金融合规生态中首个具备长期价值支撑的治理资产形态。

规则透明，支持持续参与
用户可通过质押HSK获取veHSK（质押入口：https://www.hskhodlium.xyz/）， 数量与锁仓时间成正比，采用线性释放模型，释放速率根据锁仓期限设定，鼓励长期持有与可预测的治理行为。
veHSK的上线为HashKey Chain的治理体系带来了在制度设计与社区激励上的进一步成熟，公链也从基础构建迈入了机制深化阶段。这是一次对链上金融生态治理理念的实践与回应，HashKey Chain将继续优化veHSK的使用场景与治理体验，让更多真实用户通过质押参与治理、通过治理参与共建，为打造一个开放、高效、可信的金融主链注入持久动力。
